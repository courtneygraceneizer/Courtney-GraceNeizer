          <h3>Undergraduate Research Journal Podcast: Hispanic Heritage Month (2024)</h3>
          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TpU1DTNshw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>
            As the Podcast Director for the Undergraduate Research Journal (now known as ETHEL), I hosted the very first episode in collaboration with UNC Charlotte’s Office of Undergraduate Research. This episode was part of the university’s Hispanic Heritage Month celebration and focused on the role of representation and culturally-focused research across disciplines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I interviewed two incredible student researchers about their projects, their heritage, and why inclusive research matters. It was such a powerful way to highlight diverse voices and bring those conversations into the academic spotlight.

          <p>
            This hackathon project, created with a teammate, focused on using AI image recognition to detect and report litter in local environments. We built a web app that helps simplify cleanup efforts and encourages people to take action in their communities. The process taught us so much—from CSS styling challenges to learning how to effectively integrate AI and ChatGPT for both frontend and backend features.
          </p>
          <p>
            In future versions, we hope to add geolocation, community forums, and gamified features to make the experience even more engaging and impactful.

          <p>
            As part of my summer research with the Phanstiel Lab at UNC Chapel Hill School of Medicine, I presented my work on mapping genomic data to the telomere-to-telomere assembly. It was my first formal oral presentation in a professional research setting, and it really helped sharpen my ability to explain complex genomics to a wider audience.

          <p>
            During my time at Wake Technical Community College, I was an active member of the Biology Club, where we did science outreach for underserved and rural elementary schools in North Carolina. We created fun and educational science content for students who didn’t always have access to strong STEM resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            This video, made for 3rd graders, introduces kids to essential vitamins and minerals in an approachable, engaging way. It’s one of my favorite memories of using science to inspire curiosity and learning in younger students! P.S. I'm the sweet potato.

          <p>
            I co-hosted a panel with Dr. Markia Smith and Dr. Lesley Weaver, where we had a really insightful conversation about careers in academia and industry. It was a great opportunity to hear about their journeys and share advice with other students navigating their own paths in science.
